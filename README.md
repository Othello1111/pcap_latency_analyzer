# pcap_diff
pcap_diff is a simple packet capture analysis tool used to extract time difference between the same packets in 2 different pcap files. 

An example situation is calculating the latency profile of a switch/or other network device where the same packet is recorded with highly accurate packet capture device both before the network device and after it.  Using this script a simple text based latency statistics and histogram can be generated.
